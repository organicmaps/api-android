# Organic Maps Android API: Getting Started

## Introduction

Organic Maps Android API (hereinafter referred to as *"API Library"* or just *"library"*)
provides interface for client application to perform next tasks:

* Show one or more points on offline map of [Organic Maps app][linkOM]
* Come back to the client application after selecting specific point on the map, by sending [PendingIntent][linkPIntent] with point data when user asks for more information by pressing "More Info" button in Organic Maps app
* Map screen branding : your application's icon and name (or custom title) will be placed at the top.

Thus, you can provide **two way communication between your application and Organic Maps**,
using Organic Maps to show points of interest (POI) and providing more information in your app.

Please refer to [sample application][linkSampleSource] for demo.

## Prerequisites

It is supposed that you are familiar with Android Development.
You should be familiar with concept of [Intents][linkIntents], [library projects][linkLibProj], and [PendingIntents][linkPIntent] (recommended) as well.

Organic Maps works from *Android SDK version 21 (Android 5)* and above

## Integration
First step is to clone [repository][linkRepo] or download it as an archive.

When your are done you find two folders: *lib* and *sample-app-capitals*. First one is a library project that you should add to your project.
You don't need any additional permissions in your AndroidManifest.xml to use API library, so you can write real code straight away, calling for different `Api` methods (more details below).

## Classes Overview and HOW TO
Core classes you will work with are:

* [app.organicmaps.api.Api][linkApiClass] - static class with methods such as `showPointOnMap(Activity, double, double, String)` etc.
* [app.organicmaps.api.Point][linkPointClass] - model of POI, includes lat, lon, name, id, and style data.
* [app.organicmaps.api.Response][linkRespClass] - helps you to extract response from Organic Maps by applying `Response.extractFromIntent(Intent)` to Intent. Contains Point data.

### Show Points on the Map

The simplest usage:

    public class MyPerfectActivity extends Activity {
    ...

      void showSomethingOnTheMap(SomeDomainObject arg)
      {
        // Do some work, create lat, lon, and name for point
        final double lat = ...;
        final double lon = ...;
        final String name = ...;
        // Ask Organic Maps to show the point
        Api.showPointOnMap(this, lat, lon, name);
      }
    ...

    }

For multiple points use [Point][linkPointClass] class:

    void showMultiplePoints(List<SomeDomainObject> list)
    {
      // Convert objects to OM Points
      final Point[] points = new Point[list.length];
      for (int i = 0; i < list.size; i++)
      {
        // Get lat, lon, and name from object and assign it to new Point
        points[i] = new Point(lat, lon, name);
      }
      // Show all point on the map, you could also provide some title
      Api.showPointsOnMap(this, "Look at my points, my points are amazing!", points);
    }


### Ask Organic Maps to Call my App

We support PendingIntent interaction (just like Android native
NotificationManager does). You should specify ID for each point to
distinguish it later, and PentingIntent that Organic Maps will send back to
your application when user press "More Info" button :

    // Here is how to pass points with ID ant PendingIntent
    void showMultiplePointsWithPendingIntent(List<SomeDomainObject> list, PendingIntent pendingIntent)
    {
      // Convert objects to Points
      final Point[] points = new Point[list.length];
      for (int i = 0; i < list.size; i++)
      {
        //                                      ||
        //                                      ||
        //                                      \/
        //         Now you should specify string ID for each point
        points[i] = new Point(lat, lon, name, id);
      }
      // Show all points on the map, you could also provide some title
      Api.showPointsOnMap(this, "This title says that user should choose some point", pendingIntent, points);
    }

    //Code below shows general way to extract response data
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        // Handle intent you specified with PandingIntent
        // Now it has additional information (Point).
        handleIntent(getIntent());
    }

    @Override
    protected void onNewIntent(Intent intent)
    {
      super.onNewIntent(intent);
      // if defined your activity as "SingleTop"- you should use onNewIntent callback
      handleIntent(intent);
    }

    void handleIntent(Intent intent)
    {
      // Apply Response extraction method to intent
      final Response mwmResponse = Response.extractFromIntent(this, intent);
      // Here is your point that user selected
      final Point point = mwmResponse.getPoint();
      // Now, for instance you can do some work depending on point id
      processUserInteraction(point.getId());
    }

## FAQ

#### How should I detect if user has Organic Maps installed?
`Api.isOrganicMapsInstalled(Context)` will return `true` if user has *Lite* or *Pro* version that supports API call installed.

#### Which versions of Organic Maps support API calls?
All versions since 2.4.0 and above support API calls.

#### What will happen if I call for `Api.showPoint()` but Organic Maps application is not installed?
Nothing serious. API library will show simple dialog with gentle offer to download Organic Maps. You can see how it looks like below.
